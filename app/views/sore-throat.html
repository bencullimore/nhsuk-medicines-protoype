        <h2>How to treat a sore throat yourself</h2>

      
    
      
        <p>To help soothe a sore throat and shorten how long it lasts, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>gargle with warm, salty water (children should not try this)</li>
<li>drink plenty of water</li>
<li>eat cool or soft foods</li>
<li>avoid smoking or smoky places</li>
<li>suck ice cubes, ice lollies or hard sweets – but do not give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking</li>
<li>rest</li>
</ul>

        <h2>A pharmacist can help with sore throats</h2>

<p>To help relieve the pain and discomfort of a sore throat, you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>use <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults">paracetamol</a> or <a href="/medicines/ibuprofen-for-adults/">ibuprofen</a></li>
<li>use medicated lozenges or anaesthetic sprays (although there's little proof they help)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can buy them from a supermarket or from a pharmacist without a prescription.</p>

        <h3>Antibiotics</h3>

<p>GPs do not normally prescribe antibiotics for sore throats because they will not usually relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.</p>

<p>They'll only be prescribed if your GP thinks you could have a bacterial infection.</p>

        <h2>Causes and symptoms of sore throats</h2>

<p>Sore throats are usually caused by viruses (like cold or flu) or from smoking. Very occasionally they can be caused by bacteria.</p>

<p>Symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a painful throat, especially when swallowing</li>
<li>a dry, scratchy throat</li>
<li>redness in the back of the mouth</li>
<li>bad breath</li>
<li>a mild cough</li>
<li>swollen neck glands</li>
</ul>

<p>The symptoms are similar for children, but children can also get a temperature and appear less active.</p>
